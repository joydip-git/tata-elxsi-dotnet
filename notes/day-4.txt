generics:
	a. method
	b. class
	c. interface
	d. delegate

generics with constriants:
void Add A<T>(T a, T b)
	i. where T:struct (T is Value type)
	ii. where T:class (T is reference type)
	iii. where T:new() ( T is reference rype with default ctor)
	iv. where T: <class-name> (T is of particularly of type <class-name>)

void Add<T1,T2>(T1 a, T2 b) where T2:T1
TResult Add<TInput, TResult>(TInput a) where TInput:TResult
	
generic collection classes
	a. List

indexer:
	a. it is a complex property inside the class
	b. can access data of a class object using an indexer value
	c. it does not have any name, since it works on the current instance
	//non-generic
	public Object this[int x]
	{
		//set
		//get
	}
	//generic
	public T this[int x]
	{
		// set
		// get
	}
	Note: the data type of the parameter of an indexer, could be anything, but preferrably string or int.

enumeration:
	implement IEnumerable/IEnumerable<T> interface, which provides you with GetEnumerator method
	- IEnumerator GetEnumerator() [IEnumerable]
	- IEnumerator<T> GetEnumerator() [IEnumerable<T>]
	- during enumeration do not modify the collection, you can update the values already present, but can't add new or remove existing elements from the collection
	- IEnumerator interface represents an enumerator object, used to iterate through the collection (one at a time)
	- yield keyword helps you to produce/create the enumerator, which at a time contains one value from the collection, and also helps ypu continue the for loop written inside the GetEnumerator method without completely coming out of it, but side by ie returning the value also
	
	
Sorting of List<T>:
	
	a. internalization: for internal sorting without any choice
	- T class must implement IComparable [int CompreTo(object other)]/IComparable<T> [int CompareTo(T other)] (from System namespace)
	- when you call Sort() method of List<T>, the CompareTo method of T class object will be called
	
	b. externalization: for extrnal sorting based on criteria (choice)
	- A separate class TComaprsion should be created, implementing IComparer (from System.Collections) [int Compre(object x, object y)] /IComparer<T> (from System.Collections.Generic) [int Compare(T x, T y)] interface
	- create an instance of TComaprsion clas and pass it to Sort() method of List<T> class 
	- Sort method will call Compare(T x, T y)/ Compare(object x, object y) method of the instance of TComparison class

Dictionary, SortedList, HashSet etc.
Object class
