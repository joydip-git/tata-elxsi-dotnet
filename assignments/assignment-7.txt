1. create a delegate that can call calculation methods (add, subtract,...)
   - all methods return 'int' and takes two arguments of type 'int'
   - use the delegate to invoke those methods based on choice from user

2. create a generic delegate which can used to sort any collection of any type

 example of collections:
   - List<int> numbers = new List<int>{ 1,3,5,2,4,6};
   - List<Student> students = new List<Student>{ new Student {Id=2, Name="sunil", Marks=45 }};

  - use that generic delegate to invoke some anonymous methods for sorting based on some criteria
  - for this create a separate method before Main() method (like Filter method)

	- sort the list of numbers
	- sort the list of students based on Marks or Name or Id
